# Console Tetris

A tetris clone for your console written in c#

This is the continuation of the javascript/html tetris, but not nearly as cursed and this one actually works.. 

Use the arrow keys to control the falling piece. Just a fun project for me to familiarize myself a bit more with c# and the console.
